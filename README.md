Speakability was an iOS application I developed for my final year project in university. The application offers augmentative alternative communication and speech therapy soultions to those with speech difficulties.

It was shortlisted at the [Big Chip Awards 2014] (http://www.bigchipawards.com/Shortlist2014) and most recently I sold the application to a leading university education agency in London - [Winning Education] (https://winningeducation.com). I am sad to see the application go, but its gone to a great home and I am now developing more apps including; Gradey and Domainey.

You can watch some [videos] (http://project-speakability.andrewraynes.com), [read] (http://speakability.tumblr.com) some stuff on the build or take a look at the [presentation] (https://speakerdeck.com/1raynes/speakability-ios-application) I did on Speakability.
