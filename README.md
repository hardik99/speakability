Speakability was an iOS application I developed for my final year project in university. The application offers augmentative alternative communication and speech therapy soultions to help those with speech difficulties.

It was shortlisted at the [Big Chip Awards 2014] (http://www.bigchipawards.com/Shortlist2014) and then later acquired by [Winning Education] (http://www.winningeducation.org.uk/).
